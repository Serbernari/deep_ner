Deep-NER
============

Named entity recognizer based on ELMo or BERT as feature extractor and
CRF as final classifier.

The goal of this project is creation of a simple Python package with
the sklearn-like interface for solution of different named entity 
recognition tasks in case number of labeled texts is very small (not 
greater than several thousands). Special neural network language models 
named as `ELMo<https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05365.pdf>`_ (Embeddings from Language Models)
and BERT `BERT<https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>`_ (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
ensure this possibility, because these language model were pre-trained on
large text corpora and so they can select deep semantic features from text.

Getting Started
---------------

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

To install this project on your local machine, you should run the
following commands in Terminal:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/bond005/deep_ner.git
    cd deep_ner
    sudo python setup.py install

You can also run the tests:

.. code::

    python setup.py test

Usage
~~~~~

After installing the Deep-NER can be used as Python package in your
projects. For example:

.. code::

    from deep_ner import ELMo_NER  # import the ELMo-NER package
    ner = ELMo_NER('https://tfhub.dev/google/elmo/2')  # create new named entity recognizer

To see the work of the ELMo-NER on the FactRuEval-2016 dataset, you can
run a demo

.. code::
 
    PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -u demo/demo_elmo_factrueval2016.py -d /home/user/factRuEval-2016 -m /home/user/FactRuEval2016_results/elmo_and_crf.pkl -r /home/user/FactRuEval2016_results/results_of_elmo_and_crf --max_epochs 1000 --batch 16

or (with saving model after its training):

.. code::
 
    PYTHONPATH=$PWD python -u demo/demo_elmo_factrueval2016.py -d /home/user/factRuEval-2016 -m /home/user/FactRuEval2016_results/elmo_and_crf.pkl -r /home/user/FactRuEval2016_results/results_of_elmo_and_crf --max_epochs 1000 --batch 16 --finetune_elmo

In this demo, the ELMo-NER learns to recognize the named entities LOCATION,
ORG and PERSON in Russian texts. If you specify the ``--finetune_elmo``
flag, then the CRF head will be trained with the ELMo base, else the ELMo
base will be frozen.
